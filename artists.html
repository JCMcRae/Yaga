		<h2 class="name">Pharaoh</h2>
		<h4 class="quote">"To harness the power of a king, one must encourage freedom in all ways, and war in some."</h4>
		<p>Pharaoh, an entity conceived on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu and raised within a culture rich in music and spirituality was destined to create a diverse form of free and captivating music. Born to a Native Hawaiian mother and a Military father, Pharaoh journeyed across the country as a child, never forming close relations or engaging in any normal childhood behavior. Unable to maintain lasting friendships due to the family's nomadic lifestyle, Pharaoh kept him self entertained with studying; from music, to history, to philosophy, knowledge was the young Pharaoh's escape.<br />The acquired knowledge as an adolescent helped to breed a musical phenomenon.<br />The young Pharaoh began using his cognizance to his advantage, masquerading as little-known historical and musical personas at each new school and town he encountered. While impersonating these famous persons, Pharaoh found inspiration. Whether it was the political philosophies of Benjamin Franklin, the musical styles of Michael Jackson, or the ideologies of any celebrated intellectual, Pharaoh learned and evolved.<br />To this day, Pharaoh uses his absence of ego in a race for artistic freedom, to enrich the minds of humanity through music on all wavelengths. It's not that Pharaoh is encapsulating the best qualities of every thing and person he encounters, it's that he is the encapsulation. In everything Pharaoh has learned, he has come to know one ultimate truth.</p>
